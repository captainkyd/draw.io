In this project I built a Azure network with 4 virtual machines as webservers,
one management server and one ELKS stack for network monitoring. The four
webservers are routed through a load balancer to make a redundant network 
maximizing uptime by preventing a server failure or ddos from disrupting
connectivity to the hosted DVWA page.
